# TODO

 - [] service MVP - just image processing 
 - [x] requirements 
 - []  venv (if needed)
 - [] test images

```
First MVP item is a python script that takes 
in an image from a supplied file path,
crops/selects a subarea from the image, 
and makes it transparent. 

Then we need to look into making that subarea 
flicker in and out.
